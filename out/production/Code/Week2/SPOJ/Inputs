in all times
greeks used to thinks that how can zero
have any value
because in their understanding zero is
nothing and can they define or represent
nothing
in this video we will learn about the
history of that same zero the sumerians
were the first to develop accounting
system to keep an account of their stock
of goods
like horses and cattle easily and
efficiently
their counting system were known as
hexadecimal numeral system
the sumerian system was handed down to
the acadians around
bc and then to the babylonians in 2000
bc
now we start about the history of zero
[Music]
it is said that the number zero
originated or was created in these three
places the mayan civilization
ancient babylon and ancient india zeros
were created at different times in each
of these civilizations
the maya civilization from 2000 bc to
980 in what is now
mexico used the concept of zero as a
placeholder
that is 705 is a way bigger number than
75
like using a comma in written language
the babylonians used it similarly in the
7th century bc
first time concept of zero was a number
and not merely a symbol for separation
is attributed to india
by great indian mathematician area in
the middle of 5th century a.d
it is also said that ariab hada invented
the number zero
he gave the world the digit zero for
which he became immortal
brahmagupta around 650 a.d
was the first to formalize arithmetic
operations using zero
he used dots underneath numbers to
indicate a zero
these dots were alternately referred to
as unidia which means empty
brahmagupta wrote standard rules for
reaching zero through addition and
subtraction
as well as the results of operations
with zero
the only error in his rules was division
by zero
he thinks that one divided by zero is
equal to zero
which was later proved to be false and
corrected after centuries that a number
divided by zero is actually undefined

from india zero made its way to china
and then back to the middle east in the
late 8th century
where a muslim mathematician muhammad
ibn musa al kaurishny was the first to
work on equations that equal
zero or algebra as it has come to be
known in 9th century
by 879 a d 0 was written
almost as we now know it an oval from a
dot
but in this case smaller than the other
numbers al-kawarismi called zero sifur
which means empty and thanks to the
conquest of spain by the moors
zero finally reached europe by the
middle of the 12th century
translations of al-khawrismi's work had
weaved their way to europe but it still
take few more centuries before the
concept of zero fully spread in europe
because in start religious leaders in
europe opposes zero because they
believed god is everything and
nothingness represents a devil
which is a zero
[Music]
in 120 to an italian mathematician
fibonacci
built on al calrismes works fibonacci's
developments quickly gained
notice by italian merchants and german
bankers to use xero
accountants knew their books were
balanced when the positive and negative
amounts of their assets and liabilities
equaled zero the next great
mathematician to use zero was frenchman
renee descartes the founder of the
cartesian coordinate system who used
zero
zero as the graph coordinates for x and
y axes in the middle of the 16th century
although zero was now becoming more
commonly used by the peoples
the developers of calculus lebanese and
newton
would make the final step in
understanding zero
over the century zero had different name
in india it was first called shunidia
then in middle east it was called zipper
french called its a pharaoh
then italian called izuru and finally in
english it called zero
so that was the history of zero over the
centuries
